# Past Projects

The following list details significant projects in which I played a key role, either as an independent software developer or part of a collaborative team. In addition to these major accomplishments, I have contributed to numerous smaller projects across the IT industry, government, and private sectors.

## Habibie Center Network Infrastucture

My first project as a Network Engineer involved designing and implementing the comprehensive LAN/WAN connectivity linking their two office locations.

This encompassed all stages of network engineering, from LAN and VLAN configuration to establishing robust routing protocols between the offices and the Internet. Crucially, the external connectivity utilized dedicated fiber optic cable linked directly to Indonesia's largest state-owned network operator, ensuring high reliability and performance

## ARCO/BP Network Relocation

As Assistant Project Manager for the ARCO/BP Indonesia office relocation project, I oversaw the end-to-end migration of the company's critical IT infrastructure:

- Planning and execution of the new office Local Area Network (LAN) wiring
- Design, build-out, and provisioning of the new Data Center
- Managing the physical relocation of existing hardware and infrastructure to the new site
- Ensuring the proper re-establishment and functionality of the vital microwave communication networks

## Domain Registration Service

During the Dotcom boom era, I designed and developed Namadomain.com, pioneering the first real-time domain name registration service in Indonesia when the market standard was a manual process

## Platform Intruder Detection System

I was responsible for designing, developing and deploying an advanced Intruder Detection System (IDS) for unmanned BP/Pertamina Offshore North West Java (ONWJ) oil rig platforms.

This robust system was engineered to meet extreme demands:

- Leveraging high-sensitivity sensors for reliable movement detection
- Implementing a self-sustaining power management system utilizing solar cells
- Integrating all components into a specialized, explosion-proof enclosure designed to withstand extreme weather and certified for use within hazardous areas.
- Real-time security alerts are transmitted to the headquarters via satellite communication and are monitored live through a specially designed web application accessible via a normal browser.

## Pointrek

I designed and created Pointrek, one of Indonesia's largest vessel tracking systems, supporting live tracking for over 1,000 ships.

This solution was built on a globally resilient architecture featuring live data synchronization across three major data center regions: Jakarta, Singapore, London and San Francisco

We also pioneered a two-way communication system utilizing existing satellite terminals. This system allowed clients to seamlessly route messages between the web interface, email, SMS, and a custom application embedded in our proprietary on-board device, the PAPS. This capability successfully extended beyond simple chat functionality, enabling advanced features like fish catch reporting and weather report submissions

Year: 2005 - 2016
Project: SBC, Serial Interface, Message Queue, Web Development
Stack: Nodejs, Postgresql, CouchDB, SQLite, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ
```

## 1Wave

I developed a lightweight, feature-rich vessel and port monitoring system that integrated terrestrial AIS data with RADAR data (ARPA & ECHO) called 1Wave into a single, compact, and modern application.

Key technical components included a custom-built Web Map Service (WMS) server capable of rendering specialized S-63 Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC).

The system was deployed across 23 remote ports/locations throughout Indonesia, with all acquired data securely relayed to the Headquarters via VPN/Internet connections.

Furthermore, an advanced version was created for Indonesian government patrol ships. This specialized version included a vessel instrument monitoring dashboard and a live CCTV surveillance system to serve as an additional, vital navigation aid

Year: 2020
Project: Maps, MQTT, Web Development
Stack: C#, Nodejs, MySQL, Vue, Maplibre

## Bajo Framework

I designed and created the Bajo Framework, a one-of-a-kind, MIT-licensed backend framework.

The Bajo Framework is the culmination of my experience and learning across multiple languages (Java, PHP, Node.js, Python, and Go). It is architected around a powerful, easy-to-use, modular, and plug-and-play plugin system that rigorously adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

The framework's primary goal is to empower developers by allowing them to concentrate solely on writing unique business logic, significantly accelerating the development process and serving as my way of contributing back to the community.
