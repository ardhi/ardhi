# Projects

## Habibie Center Network Infrastucture

My first project as a Network Engineer involved designing and implementing the comprehensive LAN/WAN connectivity linking their two office locations.

This encompassed all stages of network engineering, from LAN and VLAN configuration to establishing robust routing protocols between the offices and the Internet. Crucially, the external connectivity utilized dedicated fiber optic cable linked directly to Indonesia's largest state-owned network operator, ensuring high reliability and performance

## ARCO/BP Network Relocation

As Assistant Project Manager for the ARCO/BP Indonesia office relocation, I oversaw the end-to-end migration of the company's critical IT infrastructure:

- Planning and execution of the new office Local Area Network (LAN) wiring
- Design, build-out, and provisioning of the new Data Center
- Managing the physical relocation of existing hardware and infrastructure to the new site
- Ensuring the proper re-establishment and functionality of the vital microwave communication networks

## Domain Registration Service

During the Dotcom boom era, I designed and developed Namadomain.com, pioneering the first real-time domain name registration service in Indonesia when the market standard was a manual process

## Platform Intruder Detection System

I was responsible for designing, developing and deploying an advanced Intruder Detection System (IDS) for unmanned BP/Pertamina Offshore North West Java (ONWJ) oil rig platforms.

This robust system was engineered to meet extreme demands:

- Leveraging high-sensitivity sensors for reliable movement detection
- Implementing a self-sustaining power management system utilizing solar cells
- Integrating all components into a specialized, explosion-proof enclosure designed to withstand extreme weather and certified for use within hazardous areas.
- Real-time security alerts are transmitted to the headquarters via satellite communication and are monitored live through a specially designed web application accessible via a normal browser.

## Vessel Tracking System

I designed and created Pointrek, one of Indonesia's largest vessel tracking systems, supporting live tracking for over 1,000 ships.

This solution was built on a globally resilient architecture featuring live data synchronization across three major data center regions: Jakarta, Singapore, London and San Francisco

We also pioneered a two-way communication system utilizing existing satellite terminals. This system allowed clients to seamlessly route messages between the web interface, email, SMS, and a custom application embedded in our proprietary on-board device, the PAPS. This capability successfully extended beyond simple chat functionality, enabling advanced features like fish catch reporting and weather report submissions
